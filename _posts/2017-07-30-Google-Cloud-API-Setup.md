Continued from the last post. This note intends to give a small demonstration of the API usage of Google cloud.


## First you need to enable it
Here we use the translation API as the example. Search "Google translation API" in control console, and then choose "enable".

Once you've done that, create a new directory say called 'translationAPI'

## Read the Documentation and get started
https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/getting-started?csw=1
Here is the link for the translation API.
Using python will simplify the task. Install the whole set of api by
~~~
pip3 install google-cloud
~~~
or just install the translation api

~~~
pip3 install google-cloud-translate
~~~

## Setup Google cridentials


## Run the test
